    <div class="aboutMep"><p>Saying something<br>

      - It does not have to tell something bold but something behind the artwork/design/product. It can be a reason/story/feeling.<br><br>
      
      Aesthetic is important<br>
      
      - For me, aesthetics is a big part of a project. I think it is essential for me to like the way my projects look.<br><br>
      
      Stay true to me<br>
      
      - I would like to tell you something about myself as a designer through my projects. I want my projects to show who I am and what I believe.</p></div>

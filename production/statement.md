Hello, everyone! My name is Aldora Wang. I am studying at Parsons, majoring in Design and Technology. I currently live in Beijing, China. I consider myself a young visual and interaction designer.

Design Values

Saying something

- It does not have to tell something bold but something behind the artwork/design/product. It can be a reason/story/feeling.

Aesthetic is important

- For me, aesthetics is a big part of a project. I think it is essential for me to like the way my projects look.

Stay true to me

- I would like to tell you something about myself as a designer through my projects. I want my projects to show who I am and what I believe.

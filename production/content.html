Project 1
Collaborative Poetry
Collaborative Poetry is an interactive website where people can collaborate to make poetry. The purpose of this project is for people, especially poetry lovers, to interact with each other through reading others' lines and adding more lines into the poem. Nowadays, people like to post on social media, and there are always some fun and creative captions. People sometimes talk poetically. There are chances for everyone to be a poet. This project is a place for people to express themselves and collaborate. The website provides different fonts and sizes for users to choose from to create more visuals.

Project 2
Oblique Environments: Beach Scene
Oblique Environments: Beach Scene is an interactive Unity game telling a story about a little boy in a fictional world. This virtual environment will exaggerate the environmental issue, especially the issue of trash, by reimagining the physical space. The original space is Coney Island, and I am combining it with my memory of a beach in Bali. The reason I choose to focus on the trash on the beach is that I remember a beautiful sunset scene on a beach in Bali, but there was so much trash on the beach. The purpose of this project is to communicate the message of protecting our land. The little boy within the virtual space is granted the ability to fix the environmental issue by collecting a seashell.

Project 3
Children's Drawing Camera
Children's Drawing Camera is an interactive camera with a children's drawing style filter. This project is coded in p5.js sketch. The camera will track the user's face and generate a random drawing. The purpose of this project is to assert that there are things that are valuable in children's drawing style and people should give more attention to children's artwork.

Project 4
Wa!k
Wa!k is a walking stick product designed for elders. The one-child policy in China will lead to an aging population. The percentage of elders might take a big part in the population in China after the one-child policy. In China, there is a tradition to take care and look after their parents when they are old. In this generation, most families of two parents only have one child. Therefore, there might be more burden on the only child. It might be hard for their child to take care of their parents alone, without siblings. Society might want to build more nursing homes, elder apartments, services, and products for elders.
